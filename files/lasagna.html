        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Many people consider this type of strawberry ice cream recipe a '<em>hack</em>' or a '<em>cheat</em>' because we're skipping the more time-consuming and sometimes temperamental egg-custard step; but even if I didn't want to save time I'd still prefer this method. To be clear, I'm only speaking about this specific flavor of ice cream. For deep, dark chocolate, or butter pecan, I'll take the classic French-style every time. But, for sweet, juicy strawberries, I'm not a big fan of the egginess you get with the traditional method.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces of fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
