nice little simple project to familiarize myself with elements and attributes.

In this project I combined the use of nearly everything I have learned about html thus far such, only missing the <em> and <strong> tags which could've been used more but it esasn't explicty stated to use it.

Also got to use git a lot more so I can familiarize myself with that as well.
